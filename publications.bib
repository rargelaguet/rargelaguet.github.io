abstract = {{Bacterial microbiota play a critical role in mediating local and systemic immunity, and shifts in these microbial communities have been linked to impaired outcomes in critical illness. Emerging data indicate that other intestinal organisms, including bacteriophages, viruses of eukaryotes, fungi, and protozoa, are closely interlinked with the bacterial microbiota and their host, yet their collective role during antibiotic perturbation and critical illness remains to be elucidated. We employed multi-omics factor analysis (MOFA) to systematically integrate the bacterial (16S rRNA), fungal (intergenic transcribed spacer 1 rRNA), and viral (virus discovery next-generation sequencing) components of the intestinal microbiota of 33 critically ill patients with and without sepsis and 13 healthy volunteers. In addition, we quantified the absolute abundances of bacteria and fungi using 16S and 18S rRNA PCRs and characterized the short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) butyrate, acetate, and propionate using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. We observe that a loss of the anaerobic intestinal environment is directly correlated with an overgrowth of aerobic pathobionts and their corresponding bacteriophages as well as an absolute enrichment of opportunistic yeasts capable of causing invasive disease. We also observed a strong depletion of SCFAs in both disease states, which was associated with an increased absolute abundance of fungi with respect to bacteria. Therefore, these findings illustrate the complexity of transkingdom changes following disruption of the intestinal bacterial microbiome. IMPORTANCE While numerous studies have characterized antibiotic-induced disruptions of the bacterial microbiome, few studies describe how these disruptions impact the composition of other kingdoms such as viruses, fungi, and protozoa. To address this knowledge gap, we employed MOFA to systematically integrate viral, fungal, and bacterial sequence data from critically ill patients (with and without sepsis) and healthy volunteers, both prior to and following exposure to broad-spectrum antibiotics. In doing so, we show that modulation of the bacterial component of the microbiome has implications extending beyond this kingdom alone, enabling the overgrowth of potentially invasive fungi and viruses. While numerous preclinical studies have described similar findings in vitro, we confirm these observations in humans using an integrative analytic approach. These findings underscore the potential value of multi-omics data integration tools in interrogating how different components of the microbiota contribute to disease states. In addition, our findings suggest that there is value in further studying potential adjunctive therapies using anaerobic bacteria or SCFAs to reduce fungal expansion after antibiotic exposure, which could ultimately lead to improved outcomes in the intensive care unit (ICU).}},

Here we generate a multi-omics atlas of mouse early organogenesis by simultaneously profiling gene expression and chromatin accessibility from tens of thousands of single cells. We develop a computational method to leverage the multi-modal readouts to predict transcription factor binding events in cis-regulatory elements, which we then use to infer gene regulatory networks that underpin lineage commitment events. Finally, we show that these models can be used to generate in silico predictions of the effect of transcription factor perturbations.

Here, we reveal that embryoid body in vitro differentiation generates two distinct lineages of mesodermal cells matching YS and allantois respectively. Combining in vitro models with in vivo chimeric embryo analysis, we discover that Eomesodermin (Eomes) regulates the formation of a subset of YS-fated ExEM but is dispensable for allantois formation. Furthermore, simultaneous disruption of Eomes and T impedes the specification of any YS or allantois mesoderm, indicating compensatory roles for T during allantois formation when Eomes is disrupted. Our study highlights previously unrecognized functional and mechanistic diversity in ExEM diversification and endothelial development and introduces a tractable EB model to dissect the signaling pathways and transcriptional networks driving the formation of key extraembryonic tissues.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

Developmental enhancers adopt a primed chromatin state prior to their activation; however how this primed enhancer state is established, maintained, and how it affects the regulation of developmental gene networks remains poorly understood. Here, we use comparative multi-omic analyses of human and mouse early embryonic development to identify subsets of post-gastrulation lineage-specific enhancers which are epigenetically primed ahead of their activation, marked by the histone modification H3K4me1 within the epiblast. We show that epigenetic priming occurs at lineage-specific enhancers for all three germ layers, and that epigenetic priming of enhancers confers lineage-specific regulation of key developmental gene networks. Surprisingly in some cases, lineage-specific enhancers are epigenetically marked already in the zygote, weeks before their activation during lineage specification. Moreover, we outline a generalisable strategy to use naturally occurring human genetic variation to delineate important sequence determinants of primed enhancer function. Our findings identify an evolutionarily conserved program of enhancer priming and begin to dissect the temporal dynamics and mechanisms of its establishment and maintenance during early mammalian development.Competing Interest StatementWR is a consultant and shareholder of Biomodal.

	abstract = {Recent advances in organoid and genome editing technologies are allowing for perturbation experiments at an unprecedented scale. However, before doing such experiments it is important to understand the gene expression profile in each of the organoid{\textquoteright}s cells, as well as how much heterogeneity there is between individual organoids. Here we characterise an organoid model of mouse gastrulation called gastruloids using single cell RNA-sequencing of individual organoids at half-day intervals between day 3 and day 5 of differentiation (roughly corresponding to E6.5-E8.75 in vivo). Our study reveals multiple differentiation trajectories that have hitherto not been characterised in gastruloids. Intriguingly, we observe that individual gastruloids displayed a strong bias towards producing either mesodermal (largely somitic) or ectodermal (specifically neural) cell types. This bifurcation is already seen at the earliest sampled time point, and is characterised by increased activity of WNT-associated pathways in mesodermally-biased gastruloids as compared to neurally-biased gastruloids. Notably, at day 5, mesodermal gastruloids show an increase in the proportion of neural cells, while neural gastruloids do not produce notably more mesodermal cells. This is in line with previous studies on how the balance between these cell types is regulated. We demonstrate using in silico simulations that without proper understanding of the inter-organoid heterogeneity, perturbation experiments have either very high false positive or negative rates, depending on the statistical model used. Thus in future studies, modelling of inter-organoid heterogeneity will be crucial when designing organoid-based perturbation studies.HighlightsA single cell RNA-sequencing time course of day 3 to day 5 mouse gastruloids reveals multiple mesodermal and neural differentiation trajectories hitherto uncharacterised in gastruloidsSingle gastruloid, single cell RNA-sequencing of mouse gastruloids reveals that gastruloids are either mesodermally- or neurally-biasedThe two classes of gastruloid arise from differences in response strength to the WNT-agonist chironAt day 5, mesodermal gastruloids start making more neural cells, while neural gastruloids do not make more mesodermal cells, aligning with previously studied in vivo feedback loopsWe show using simulations that understanding interorganoid heterogeneity is a crucial consideration in the design and analysis of well-powered organoid-based perturbation studiesCompeting Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

Computational lineage reconstruction identified complex waves of blood and endothelial development, including a new programme for somite-derived endothelium.

Finally, we defined developmental state/fate relationships by combining orthotopic grafting, microscopic analysis and scRNA-seq to transcriptionally determine cell fates of grafted primitive streak regions after 24 h of in vitro embryo culture. Experimentally determined fate outcomes were in good agreement with computationally predicted fates, demonstrating how classical grafting experiments can be revisited to establish high-resolution cell state/fate relationships.

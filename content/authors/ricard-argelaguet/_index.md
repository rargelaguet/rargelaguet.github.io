## About Me

I am a computational biologist motivated by the applications of machine learning and artifical intelligence to the field of biology.

I did my PhD in the groups of [John Marioni (EMBL-EBI, now at Genentech)](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/research/marioni/) and [Oliver Stegle (EMBL & DKFZ)](https://www.embl.org/groups/stegle/), followed by a short postdoctoral stay in the group of Wolf Reik at the Babraham Institute. I developed methods for single-cell and multi-omics data integration, the most popular one being [MOFA](https://biofam.github.io/MOFA2/). I also worked on generating data resources in the context of embryonic development. Some examples are the single-cell multi-modal atlases of [mouse gastrulation](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1825-8) and [early organogenesis](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.06.15.496239v1).

Currently, I am working as a Senior Scientist at [Altos Labs](https://altoslabs.com/) in the AI/ML team led by [Thore Graepel](https://thoregraepel.github.io/), where I work on modelling gene perturbation screenings to characterise the regulatory networks that underlie cellular rejuvenation programming.

I am a strong advocate of open and reproducible science. If you are interested in my work please check [my GitHub page](https://github.com/rargelaguet), which includes code to reproduce many of the results from our publications.

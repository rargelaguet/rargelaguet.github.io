summary: Fundamentals of Computational Biology is a compulsory subject of the curriculum of the bachelor's degree in Human Biology at the Universitat Pompeu Fabra. Its goal is to introduce concepts and basic tools of computation and information technologies, required to address biological questions using a computer. The purpose of introducing this subject at the beginning of the curriculum is to enable the student using the tools and abilities acquired in FCB throughout the whole degree. The main topics of FCB are manipulating files from the command line, programming with Python and R, and developing automatized and reproducible workflows, in the context of biological data analysis.

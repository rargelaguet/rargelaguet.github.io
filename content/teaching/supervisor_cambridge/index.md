summary: Mathematical Biology is the first-year Natural Sciences mathematics course designed for biologists. The course teaches a range of skills in mathematical modelling, probability and statistics and simple computer programming. The course is designed to approach these areas from an integrated biological point of view. A range of mathematical and statistical techniques, including ordinary differential equations, local stability analysis, coupled differential equations, hypothesis testing, regression, matrix algebra, basic probability and probability distributions are introduced in the context of biological systems.

abstract: Technological advances have enabled the profiling of multiple molecular
  layers at single-cell resolution, assaying cells from multiple samples or conditions.
  Consequently, there is a growing need for computational strategies to analyze data
  from complex experimental designs that include multiple data modalities and multiple
  groups of samples. We present Multi-Omics Factor Analysis v2 (MOFA+), a statistical
  framework for the comprehensive and scalable integration of single-cell multi-modal
  data. MOFA+ reconstructs a low-dimensional representation of the data using computationally
  efficient variational inference and supports flexible sparsity constraints, allowing
  to jointly model variation across multiple sample groups and data modalities.

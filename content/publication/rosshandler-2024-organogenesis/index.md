abstract: Early organogenesis represents a key step in animal development, during
  which pluripotent cells diversify to initiate organ formation. Here, we sampled
  300,000 single-cell transcriptomes from mouse embryos between E8.5 and E9.5 in 6-h
  intervals and combined this new dataset with our previous atlas (E6.5-E8.5) to produce
  a densely sampled timecourse of &gt;400,000 cells from early gastrulation to organogenesis.
  Computational lineage reconstruction identified complex waves of blood and endothelial
  development, including a new programme for somite-derived endothelium. We also dissected
  the E7.5 primitive streak into four adjacent regions, performed scRNA-seq and predicted
  cell fates computationally. Finally, we defined developmental state/fate relationships
  by combining orthotopic grafting, microscopic analysis and scRNA-seq to transcriptionally
  determine cell fates of grafted primitive streak regions after 24 h of in vitro
  embryo culture. Experimentally determined fate outcomes were in good agreement with
  computationally predicted fates, demonstrating how classical grafting experiments
  can be revisited to establish high-resolution cell state/fate relationships. Such
  interdisciplinary approaches will benefit future studies in developmental biology
  and guide the in vitro production of cells for organ regeneration and repair.

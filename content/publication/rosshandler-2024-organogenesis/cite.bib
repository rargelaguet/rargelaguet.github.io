 abstract = {Early organogenesis represents a key step in animal development, during which pluripotent cells diversify to initiate organ formation. Here, we sampled 300,000 single-cell transcriptomes from mouse embryos between E8.5 and E9.5 in 6-h intervals and combined this new dataset with our previous atlas (E6.5-E8.5) to produce a densely sampled timecourse of &gt;400,000 cells from early gastrulation to organogenesis. Computational lineage reconstruction identified complex waves of blood and endothelial development, including a new programme for somite-derived endothelium. We also dissected the E7.5 primitive streak into four adjacent regions, performed scRNA-seq and predicted cell fates computationally. Finally, we defined developmental state/fate relationships by combining orthotopic grafting, microscopic analysis and scRNA-seq to transcriptionally determine cell fates of grafted primitive streak regions after 24 h of in vitro embryo culture. Experimentally determined fate outcomes were in good agreement with computationally predicted fates, demonstrating how classical grafting experiments can be revisited to establish high-resolution cell state/fate relationships. Such interdisciplinary approaches will benefit future studies in developmental biology and guide the in vitro production of cells for organ regeneration and repair.},

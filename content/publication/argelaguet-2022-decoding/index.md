abstract: Following gastrulation, the three primary germ layers develop into the major
  organs in a process known as organogenesis. Single-cell RNA sequencing has enabled
  the profiling of the gene expression dynamics of these cell fate decisions, yet
  a comprehensive map of the interplay between transcription factors and cis-regulatory
  elements is lacking, as are the underlying gene regulatory networks. Here we generate
  a multi-omics atlas of mouse early organogenesis by simultaneously profiling gene
  expression and chromatin accessibility from tens of thousands of single cells. We
  develop a computational method to leverage the multi-modal readouts to predict transcription
  factor binding events in cis-regulatory elements, which we then use to infer gene
  regulatory networks that underpin lineage commitment events. Finally, we show that
  these models can be used to generate in silico predictions of the effect of transcription
  factor perturbations. We validate this experimentally by showing that Brachyury
  is essential for the differentiation of neuromesodermal progenitors to somitic mesoderm
  fate by priming cis-regulatory elements.

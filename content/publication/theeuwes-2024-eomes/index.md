abstract: During mouse gastrulation, extraembryonic mesoderm (ExEM) contributes to
  the extraembryonic yolk sac (YS) and allantois, both of which are essential for
  successful gestation. Although the genetic networks coordinating intra-embryonic
  mesodermal subtype specification are well-studied, the mechanisms driving ExEM diversification
  are poorly understood. Here, we reveal that embryoid body in vitro differentiation
  generates two distinct lineages of mesodermal cells matching YS and allantois respectively.
  Combining in vitro models with in vivo chimeric embryo analysis, we discover that
  Eomesodermin (Eomes) regulates the formation of a subset of YS-fated ExEM but is
  dispensable for allantois formation. Furthermore, simultaneous disruption of Eomes
  and T impedes the specification of any YS or allantois mesoderm, indicating compensatory
  roles for T during allantois formation when Eomes is disrupted. Our study highlights
  previously unrecognized functional and mechanistic diversity in ExEM diversification
  and endothelial development and introduces a tractable EB model to dissect the signaling
  pathways and transcriptional networks driving the formation of key extraembryonic
  tissues.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

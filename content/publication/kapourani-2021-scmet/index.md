abstract: Abstract High-throughput single-cell measurements of DNA methylomes can
  quantify methylation heterogeneity and uncover its role in gene regulation. However,
  technical limitations and sparse coverage can preclude this task. scMET is a hierarchical
  Bayesian model which overcomes sparsity, sharing information across cells and genomic
  features to robustly quantify genuine biological heterogeneity. scMET can identify
  highly variable features that drive epigenetic heterogeneity, and perform differential
  methylation and variability analyses. We illustrate how scMET facilitates the characterization
  of epigenetically distinct cell populations and how it enables the formulation of
  novel hypotheses on the epigenetic regulation of gene expression. scMET is available
  at https://github.com/andreaskapou/scMET .

abstract: The activation of the embryonic genome marks the first major wave of transcription
  in the developing organism. Zygotic genome activation (ZGA) in mouse 2-cell embryos
  and 8-cell embryos in humans is crucial for development. Here, we report the discovery
  of human 8-cell-like cells (8CLCs) among naive embryonic stem cells, which transcriptionally
  resemble the 8-cell human embryo. They express ZGA markers, including ZSCAN4 and
  LEUTX, and transposable elements, such as HERVL and MLT2A1. 8CLCs show reduced SOX2
  levels and can be identified using TPRX1 and H3.Y marker proteins in vitro. Overexpression
  of the transcription factor DUX4 and spliceosome inhibition increase human ZGA-like
  transcription. Excitingly, the 8CLC markers TPRX1 and H3.Y are also expressed in
  ZGA-stage 8-cell human embryos and may thus be relevant in vivo. 8CLCs provide a
  unique opportunity to characterize human ZGA-like transcription and might provide
  critical insights into early events in embryogenesis in humans.

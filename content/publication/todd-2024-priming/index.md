abstract: Embryonic development requires the accurate spatiotemporal execution of
  cell lineage-specific gene expression programs, which are controlled by transcriptional
  enhancers. Developmental enhancers adopt a primed chromatin state prior to their
  activation; however how this primed enhancer state is established, maintained, and
  how it affects the regulation of developmental gene networks remains poorly understood.
  Here, we use comparative multi-omic analyses of human and mouse early embryonic
  development to identify subsets of post-gastrulation lineage-specific enhancers
  which are epigenetically primed ahead of their activation, marked by the histone
  modification H3K4me1 within the epiblast. We show that epigenetic priming occurs
  at lineage-specific enhancers for all three germ layers, and that epigenetic priming
  of enhancers confers lineage-specific regulation of key developmental gene networks.
  Surprisingly in some cases, lineage-specific enhancers are epigenetically marked
  already in the zygote, weeks before their activation during lineage specification.
  Moreover, we outline a generalisable strategy to use naturally occurring human genetic
  variation to delineate important sequence determinants of primed enhancer function.
  Our findings identify an evolutionarily conserved program of enhancer priming and
  begin to dissect the temporal dynamics and mechanisms of its establishment and maintenance
  during early mammalian development.Competing Interest StatementWR is a consultant

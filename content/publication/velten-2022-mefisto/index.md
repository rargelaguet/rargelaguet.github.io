abstract: Factor analysis is a widely used method for dimensionality reduction in
  genome biology, with applications from personalized health to single-cell biology.
  Existing factor analysis models assume independence of the observed samples, an
  assumption that fails in spatio-temporal profiling studies. Here we present MEFISTO,
  a flexible and versatile toolbox for modeling high-dimensional data when spatial
  or temporal dependencies between the samples are known. MEFISTO maintains the established
  benefits of factor analysis for multimodal data, but enables the performance of
  spatio-temporally informed dimensionality reduction, interpolation, and separation
  of smooth from non-smooth patterns of variation. Moreover, MEFISTO can integrate
  multiple related datasets by simultaneously identifying and aligning the underlying
  patterns of variation in a data-driven manner. To illustrate MEFISTO, we apply the
  model to different datasets with spatial or temporal resolution, including an evolutionary
  atlas of organ development, a longitudinal microbiome study, a single-cell multi-omics
  atlas of mouse gastrulation and spatially resolved transcriptomics. MEFISTO models
  bulk and single-cell multi-omics data with temporal or spatial dependencies for
  interpretable pattern discovery and integration.

abstract: The development of single-cell multimodal assays provides a powerful tool
  for investigating multiple dimensions of cellular heterogeneity, enabling new insights
  into development, tissue homeostasis and disease. A key challenge in the analysis
  of single-cell multimodal data is to devise appropriate strategies for tying together
  data across different modalities. The term ‘data integration’ has been used to describe
  this task, encompassing a broad collection of approaches ranging from batch correction
  of individual omics datasets to association of chromatin accessibility and genetic
  variation with transcription. Although existing integration strategies exploit similar
  mathematical ideas, they typically have distinct goals and rely on different principles
  and assumptions. Consequently, new definitions and concepts are needed to contextualize
  existing methods and to enable development of new methods. As the number of single-cell
  experiments with multiple data modalities increases, Argelaguet and colleagues review
  the concepts and challenges of data integration.

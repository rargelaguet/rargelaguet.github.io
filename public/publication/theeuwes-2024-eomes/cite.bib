 abstract = {During mouse gastrulation, extraembryonic mesoderm (ExEM) contributes to the extraembryonic yolk sac (YS) and allantois, both of which are essential for successful gestation. Although the genetic networks coordinating intra-embryonic mesodermal subtype specification are well-studied, the mechanisms driving ExEM diversification are poorly understood. Here, we reveal that embryoid body in vitro differentiation generates two distinct lineages of mesodermal cells matching YS and allantois respectively. Combining in vitro models with in vivo chimeric embryo analysis, we discover that Eomesodermin (Eomes) regulates the formation of a subset of YS-fated ExEM but is dispensable for allantois formation. Furthermore, simultaneous disruption of Eomes and T impedes the specification of any YS or allantois mesoderm, indicating compensatory roles for T during allantois formation when Eomes is disrupted. Our study highlights previously unrecognized functional and mechanistic diversity in ExEM diversification and endothelial development and introduces a tractable EB model to dissect the signaling pathways and transcriptional networks driving the formation of key extraembryonic tissues.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

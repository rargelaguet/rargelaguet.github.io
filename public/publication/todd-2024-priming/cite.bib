 abstract = {Embryonic development requires the accurate spatiotemporal execution of cell lineage-specific gene expression programs, which are controlled by transcriptional enhancers. Developmental enhancers adopt a primed chromatin state prior to their activation; however how this primed enhancer state is established, maintained, and how it affects the regulation of developmental gene networks remains poorly understood. Here, we use comparative multi-omic analyses of human and mouse early embryonic development to identify subsets of post-gastrulation lineage-specific enhancers which are epigenetically primed ahead of their activation, marked by the histone modification H3K4me1 within the epiblast. We show that epigenetic priming occurs at lineage-specific enhancers for all three germ layers, and that epigenetic priming of enhancers confers lineage-specific regulation of key developmental gene networks. Surprisingly in some cases, lineage-specific enhancers are epigenetically marked already in the zygote, weeks before their activation during lineage specification. Moreover, we outline a generalisable strategy to use naturally occurring human genetic variation to delineate important sequence determinants of primed enhancer function. Our findings identify an evolutionarily conserved program of enhancer priming and begin to dissect the temporal dynamics and mechanisms of its establishment and maintenance during early mammalian development.Competing Interest StatementWR is a consultant and shareholder of Biomodal.
